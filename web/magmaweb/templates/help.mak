	<h2>Brief explanation of the MAGMaViewer interface</h2>
	<p>Molecules table (upper left)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Contains the candidate molecules retrieved from the PubChem
			database</li>
		<li>The Name column contains the actual name for the correct
			candidate and the PubChem CID for all other candidates</li>
		<li>You can sort on a column by clicking the header</li>
		<li>You can filter, hide and show columns via the drop-down menu
			that is available at the column header</li>
		<li>You can change order and width of the columns</li>
		<li>By clicking a row of the table, you can select a candidate
			molecule</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Chromatogram (bottom left)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In this case, the chromatogram consists of only one point
			representing the spectral tree measured for the compound of interest</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you have selected a candidate molecule the annotated
		spectral tree becomes available on the right. Substructures (upper
		right)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This table has a tree structure: the folder icons allow you
			to open up the next level substructures. At the same time, the
			corresponding spectrum is shown at the bottom.</li>
		<li>Selecting a substructure highlights the corresponding peak in
			the spectra below</li>
	</ul>
	<p>MS spectral tree (bottom right)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Selecting a peak by clicking one of the green triangles
			highlights the corresponding substructure.</li>
		<li>You can zoom in using the mouse-wheel</li>
	</ul>
